            Bangladesh has a young population, a government pushing for
            digitalization and a rapidly expanding startup scene, creating a
            range of opportunities. Foreign investors are tapping into the huge
            potential for growth.

            Investment is flowing into Bangladeshâ€™s startup companies, attracted
            by a young workforce, advancing digital policies and the potential
            for exponential expansion.

            A combined $380 million in disclosed investments headed to more than
            50 startups in 2021, according to Dhaka-based news outlet Future
            Startup, and many others completed undisclosed deals. Dhaka-based
            IOT company Bondstein Technologies Limited, for instance, secured a
            $1 million investment from a group led by Runner Trading Limited. It
            will use the funds for R&D and expansion. While this illustrates
            impressive momentum, the scale of investment still leaves Bangladesh
            behind some of its emerging-market peers, making the opportunities
            for growth all the more real.

          <p className="text-xl ml-3 my-12 font-light">
            Rapid expansion of this sector is set to continue, underpinned by
            fast economic growth across the country and a recovery from the
            worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even though there are still some
            challenges to overcome, the opportunities are myriad and progress so
            far is good. E-commerce, healthcare, logistics, education, travel
            and fintech are attracting the most investment, according to Future
            Startup.
