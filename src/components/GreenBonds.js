            Bangladesh has much to offer investors, including developing
            opportunities in sustainable finance and green investment, exposure

            As one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, the fabric of the
            country is changing. That means more capital is needed to keep pace
            with a drive to finance building and infrastructure. At the same
            time, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations to climate
            change, with densely populated areas, low elevation and multiple
            rivers.

            This puts environmental concerns high up the agenda for
            policymakers, who are set on simplifying both the environment for
            investing in green assets and access for international investors.
            The central bank has put sustainable finance at the heart of its
            operations, and regulations are evolving to increase the size of
            capital markets and open them up.
