                To fuel the country's rapid economic growth, Bangladesh is
                transforming its infrastructure through mega projects spanning
                new ports, rail links and bridges. The Asian Development Bank
                notes that increasing capital flows is critical to improving the
                competitiveness of domestic industries and overall economic
                efficiency â€“ and Bangladesh is doing just that.
